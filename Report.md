## Wifi Data Plots

We measured the traffic congestion patterns on the nearby street using the Raspberry Pi as a wireless sensor. The data was collected by running [wifi_scan.py](https://github.com/BostonUniversitySeniorDesign/2021-hardware-miniproj/blob/main/wifi_scan.py), which created .json files to log any wifi/ wireless activity. The data was collected in 3 trials and plotted via [wifi_plot.py](https://github.com/BostonUniversitySeniorDesign/2021-hardware-miniproj/blob/main/wifi_plot.py):
