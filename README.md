# Fall 2021 Senior Design Hardware Miniproject

*Team 21: Ashley Chong and Daniel Kao*

This is a repository for the Fall 2021 ECE Senior Capstone Miniproject. We have conducted a wifi scan in an off-campus apartment, using a Raspberry Pi, in order to measure the wireless activity in the surrounding area. With this, we were able to track the traffic congestion patterns (including automobiles, bikes, and/or pedestrians) on the nearby street.

Please see [Report.md](https://github.com/ashleychong1/senior-design-hw-miniproject-team-21/blob/main/Report.md) for our written report.
